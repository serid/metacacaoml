# MetaCaCaOML
is a procedural language designed for general-purpose and systems programming. By combining the imperative paradigm with an advanced type system, it provides a way to express data-oriented algorithms which are also highly polymorphic and generic.

Its core features:
| Feature | Haskell equivalent | Implementation status |
| - | - | - |
| Some kind of System F derivative | -//- | ✅ |
| Classes | Data types | ✅ |
| Delimited continuations | -//- | ❌ |
| Seeds | Implicit variables | ❌ |
| Interfaces | Typeclasses | ❌ |
| Compilation-time metaprogramming | Templates | ❌ |
